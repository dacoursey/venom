## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Is Club Venom restricted to CRHS athletes?

No.  During the high school wrestling season, Club Venom is paused while we focus on Catawba Ridge.  For the other 8 months of the year we work with any athlete who can make it out to training.

#### What are the important dates?

High School Season - November through February
Club Venom - April through October

#### What style to you teach?

We coach wrestlers on all three styles - folkstyle, freestyle, and greco roman. In the off-season from school the focus shifts away from folkstyle, but many of the concepts still benefit an athlete who does not compete in freestyle tournaments.

#### Do you have a team?

Yes! We are new, but Club Venom is traveling to many local area tournaments to compete as a team.
